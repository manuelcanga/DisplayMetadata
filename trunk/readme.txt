Shows metas( fields, custom fields and protected metas ) in a metabox for posts( any CPT ), terms( any taxonomy ), comments and users. Metas are displayed for humans( organized and unserialized ). This metabox only will be displayed per either administrator users or users with `display_metadata_metabox` capability.

== Description ==

As a developer you normally need know about a value of some meta( or properties ) of a post, term o user.

As a sysadmin maybe you need know about which meta are created in posts/terms/comments/users in order to remove which are unnecessary.

As a plugin author you need check if you plugin is adding  meta rightly.

As a theme author you need know about which meta is available in order to can use they in your themes.

In all these cases( and others ), you can use Display Meta plugin.
